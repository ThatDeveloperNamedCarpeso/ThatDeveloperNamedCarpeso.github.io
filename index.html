                <div>I've always been quiet in person.</div><div><br></div><div>My friends know me differently, but I have a difficulty sharing my thoughts and my testimonies to investigators, new converts and people in general. I can't relate much to people, and sometimes I leave the conversation because I am not confident enough to share.</div><div><br></div><div>But I'm going on a mission.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>I felt it in my heart. I felt the spirit telling me to trust in the Lord and that all will be okay. I continually prayed for guidance, faced many challenges and struggled to be worthy of the Lord's blessings.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>I wanted to serve. I will serve. And we all can serve our Heavenly Father, even during these times. No matter how difficult our situation can be, we can always spare a small amount of time to serve.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>We can share the gospel, or help a friend in need. We can read a full chapter in the book of mormon, or just a few verses.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>No matter where we are, or what we are doing, we can serve him. We can minister to our fellow neighbors and friends, and share the blessings we receive through our obedience.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>If we fail or make mistakes, we can receive forgiveness through the atonement of Jesus Christ. Each failure is a lesson we can learn, not what defines us.</div><div><br></div><div>I am incredibly thankful for the support and love that my ward, my stake and my friends have given me throughout my journey. I am thankful and truly blessed to have a family that helped me come unto christ, and taught me about the gospel at an early age.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Most of all, I am thankful to Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ, who has always given me hope and strength that I can, one day, achieve my goals.</div><div><br></div><div>I testify to you that as you strive to be better and minister to those in need, God will bless you and nourish you physically and spiritually. I know that as we continue to hold strong to our faith, the Lord will guide us through our struggles and challenges.</div><div><br></div><div>I am a very quiet person, and that hasn't changed for the most part. But through the Gospel of Jesus Christ, my mouth has been opened to share the gospel of Jesus Christ. And I testify that yours will be too.&nbsp;</div>
