# The Story of Abinadi: Faith in times of Peril 

During the reign of King Noah, the people of Limhi began to enter into wickedness. Their king grew more greedy and hungrier for the luxurious and elegant things, laid unfair taxes to his people, began to grow idolatrous and did not follow the ways of his father. He only supported himself, and did many more wicked things that are not aligned with the commandments of our heavenly father. ***(Mosiah 11:2-15)***

At the same time, his people followed into wickedness. As more and more people began to forget the way of their fathers. They also grew in pride and slowly turned their backs from god. The Lamanites began to attack them, but they successfully fended them off. This, however, only grew their pride in their hearts. 

It was also during this time that a prophet named Abinadi was among them, preaching the words of God. He was commanded by our Heavenly Father to preach repentance unto the people of Limhi and tell them that *"except they repent, I[Heavenly Father] will visit them in mine anger."* **(Mosiah 11: 21)**.

King Noah and the people did not like this, and so he was sent to the King and his Priests to stand trial. He faced imprisonment and ultimately died, but not before he fulfilled the lord's commandment to preach repentance and deliver his message.

As he delivered his message, one of the priests named Alma was moved by his testimony, and repented of his sins later on ***(Mosiah 17: 2-3, Entire Chapter 18)***. And the rest, as in the Book of Mormon, is history.

### An Example of Faith in times of Peril

Abinadi is one of my favorite Book of Mormon Prophets. He demonstrated absolute trust and faith in our heavenly father, even commanding the soldiers to *"Touch me not, for God shall smite you if ye lay your hands upon me, for I have not delivered the message the Lord has sent me to deliver" **(Mosiah 13:3)***. 

Even facing certain death, he held strong to his faith and preached unto the King. He knew the lord's work is true, and that he will be protected by Heavenly Father if he followed the commandments, just like their forefathers. 

Just like Abinadi, we all face our own personal struggles. But, Abinadi has taught us on how to overcome them: through our faith in Jesus Christ.

In today's world, we are faced with more challenges, trials and personal struggles. Satan is continuously on the move, trying every avenue and direction to attack you and your faith. He knows what your weakness is, and will not stop until he succeeds. 

But, just like the adversary, Heavenly Father has given us tools for these times. The Book of Mormon is the shield to Satan's sword, helping us defend from his attacks and strengthening our faith as we continuously read and ponder its words. 

Modern day Prophets just like Abinadi are called by God to lead us into righteousness and give us directions. Missionaries who are called of God are sent to each and every household to preach the restored gospel of Jesus Christ.

We are blessed to have many, miraculous works of the Lord in today's time that were not readily available during the Ancient Americas, but the message is plain and simple, and has not changed: through faith in our saviour Jesus Christ, we are able to access his Atonement and repent for our sins, and that *"...redemption cometh through Christ the Lord, who is the very Eternal Father..." **(Mosiah 16: 15).***

### Final Thoughts and Testimonies

As I wrote this article, I pondered how much Abinadi's words have given me hope that our faith can help us get through rough times. Coincidentally, I asked a friend her thoughts about this.

Sister Ashley, a good friend, shared with me how Abinadi was an example to her:

> *"We stand for what is right even when no one does. Nowadays, the standards of the world change so rapidly. But just like Abinadi, we need not to fear. We can still live our lives according to God's standards."*

She testified that our faith need not change even if the world's standards are continuously changing for the words. 

I then asked her about how important having faith like Abinadi was in these modern times:

> *"These perilous times we are in will totally shake us, break us, or even put us to darkness. But having steadfast faith and perfect brightness of hope in Christ will help us to be able to survive and trust that God is with us always no matter what happen."*

I can testify that this is true. Our faith is continuously under attack by Satan, but having "steadfast faith and perfect brightness of hope in Christ" can and will help us overcome our personal challenges.

She shared one last testimony to those who are in need of faith:

> *"I know we might think Abinadi was way too faithful and courageous compared to us. But one thing is for sure, God is always bound. He fulfills His word. Abinadi trusted that. And we can trust Him, too. Pres. Monson said, 'Your future is as bright as your faith! As we hope for a brighter future, may we strive to keep our faith even brighter'."*

As we struggle to gain faith in these perilous times, we must always remember that, like Abinadi, God will guide us and protect us if we have faith in him. Trust his plan, and all is well. 

I testify of his marvelous works, and that we are all his children whom he loves very much. I testify that, though these times may be full of darkness and
